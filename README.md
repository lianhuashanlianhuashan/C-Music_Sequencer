This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C to store and manipulate musical notes ordered by time.
Each node represents a note with frequency, bar, and index, using a computed key to maintain BST order.

Key features

  Dynamic BST insertion, search, and deletion with proper memory management
  
  In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals
  
  Playlist generation via in-order traversal
  
  Song transformations: reverse playback and harmonic note generation
  
  Recursive algorithms and pointer-based data structures

Skills demonstrated

  Data structures (BSTs)
  
  Recursion and tree traversal
  
  Manual memory management in C
  
  Algorithmic problem solving
  
  Working with structured data and constraints
